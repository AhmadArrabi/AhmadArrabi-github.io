I am a 3rd year computer science Ph.D. student at the university of vermont, working with [Prof. Safwan Wshah](https://www.wshahaigroup.com/about). My research interest is in **generative models** and **cross-view synthesis**. I also do some applied work, mainly in medical imaging and remote sensing. Currenlty, I am more focused on **score based** diffusion models and their applications. 

I always find joy in research and discovery, don't hesitate to reach out for collaboration! 😁
